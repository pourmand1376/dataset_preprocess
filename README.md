# dicom-anevrism

This project receives a folder containing patients who have done a CT-Scan and extracts images from all subfolders. The code is written to be compatible for specific data we have used. 

`DICOM` files are stored normally but annotations are stored in a weird format which I have described [here](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/discussions/1653).
